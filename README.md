The idea behind my implementation for the solution is to create data based on coordinates of hexagons, which will be further elaborated, and its own name. Once the hexagons are all created. 

There are 4 operations that can be done for the current version of the program: query (asking for neighbors of a hexagon), add (add a hexagon with its neighbor being known), remove (delete a hexagon and check whether it is appropriate to delete or not), and exit (terminate the program)
